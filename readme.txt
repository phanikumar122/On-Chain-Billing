 On-Chain Billing System (Aptos Move)
 Features
• Decentralized bill storage — bills are stored on-chain, not in centralized servers.
• Tamper-proof history — once a bill is issued, it cannot be modified or deleted.
• Timestamps for tracking — every bill includes a blockchain timestamp.
• Buyer history retrieval — buyers can view all bills ever issued to them.
• Event logs — off-chain indexers can subscribe to billing events.
• Future-ready UI — data can easily be visualized into daily, weekly, monthly, yearly expenses.
 Use Case Example
• Seller issues a bill: Alice (seller) issues a bill of 50 APT to Bob (buyer).
• Bill details: 'Groceries at Store X'. Stored on-chain under Bob’s account.
• Buyer views bills: Bob queries his bills via a DApp or CLI and sees all his transactions.
• UI calculates expenses: Frontend converts blockchain timestamps into human-readable dates
and groups bills.
 Smart Contract
• Module: billing_addr::billing
• Stores a global billing registry.
• Functions: init_module, issue_bill, get_bills_by_buyer, count_bills_for_buyer
• Bill Struct includes seller, buyer, bill_id, amount, details (UTF-8), timestamp.
